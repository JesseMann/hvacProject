            <h2>When the Compressor Is Replaced, Is the Whole Unit Due for Replacement?</h2>
            <p>
              The compressor is the hardest-working component in your entire HVAC system. This is what is responsible for ultimately removing the heat and humidity from your home. As such, it is true that the compressor is usually the first thing to cause problems when they age. If you can find a compressor that matches the indoor components and the indoor components are not outdated, then it is okay to replace just the compressor. However, if the unit is so old that a matching unit cannot be found, or even if the indoor portion is outdated and inefficient, it may be worth your time to consider a complete replacement.

            <h2>How Can I Tell if My Unit Is Still under Warranty?</h2>
            <p>
              The manufacturer of your HVAC system will provide you with the warranty information whenever your unit is purchased. If you have recently moved into a new home that has an existing unit, you will need to find out whether or not it is under a guarantee and whether or not that guarantee can be transferred to you. However, if you purchased it on your own, you should be able to contact the manufacturer and provide the serial number to discover whether or not certain repairs and parts are covered in the event of a failure.

            <h2>When Should I Call a Professional?</h2>
            <p>
              If you are experiencing any issues with your HVAC system, such as the inability to cool your space properly or a failure of your unit to kick on, then there are some things that you might be able to do to resolve the situation on your own such as checking the thermostat, changing the filter and even pressing the reset button located on the indoor portion of the unit. However, if none of these things seem to work and you cannot maintain a steady comfort level, then professional repair may be necessary. You should also have a professional come into your home each year prior to the main cooling season to ensure that all of your components are safe and ready to be used.            </p>

            <h2>What’s That Sound?</h2>
            <p>
              These days, HVAC systems are designed to provide you with maximum performance with as little sound as possible. That isn’t to say that you won’t hear it running at all; it just means that they are much quieter these days than they once were. If you hear something out of the ordinary, it could be any number of things. The best thing to do at this point is turn off the unit, contact a professional, discuss the issue, and set up an appointment if necessary.            </p>

            <h2>Why Is My Air Conditioner Freezing Up?</h2>
            <p>
              There are many things that could cause your air conditioner to freeze up. It could be that there is not enough refrigerant in the system, that the evaporator coil is dirty, or that the blower motor or the relays in the unit are defective. While you can clean the evaporator coil on your own, you cannot recharge the refrigerant and fix the leak. What’s more, you should also contact a professional to fix motors and relays, especially if your unit is still under warranty.
              While some fixes are quite simple, others are more complex and require professional assistance.            </p>
